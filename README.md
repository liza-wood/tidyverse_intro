## Introduction

This tutorial is an introduction to data wrangling and visualization using functions from the `tidyverse`. It uses data from the Palmer Station's Long Term Ecological Research program based in Antarctica, including the `palmerpenguins` and weather monitoring data. These lessons walk through key steps in the data wrangling phase, including subsetting data, summarizing data at aggregate levels, creating new variables using conditional statements, working with dates, joining together multiple data frames, and reshaping data. This lesson also provides an introduction to combining data wrangling with visualization.
