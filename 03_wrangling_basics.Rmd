# Data wrangling basics

## Outline
* Reducing data dimensionality:
  * `select`: Name the columns to keep, separated by a comma. Using select will reduce the number of columns in your data frame
  * `filter`: Set conditions by which you want to filter (keep) some of the data. Using the filter function will reduce the number of rows in your data frame
   * `is.na()`: Insert a column name to get a logical vector indicated whether each value in that row has an NA value
* Combining multiple steps
  * `%v%`: Link together multiple steps by 'piping' the output of one line of code into the next
* Creating new variables
  * Summary tables
    * `group_by`: Set a column (or columns) by which you want to perform a summarizing function on. Using this function does apparently nothing on its own, but is powerful when paired with `summarize` (or `mutate`)
    * `summarize`: Create a new variable by performing a variety of summary/transformative functions on an existing column (or set of columns). When paired with `group_by`, data is reduced to a summary table
  * New columns
    * `mutate`: Create a new column by assigning a value (transformed or otherwise)
    * `case_when`: Pair with mutate to create a new variable that is based on >1 conditions, typically for creating categorical variables
* Miscallenous
  * `arrange`
  * `rename`

## Reducing data dimensionality

The functions, `select` and `filter`, are what you can use to reduce dimensionality of your data frame. That means reducing the number of column (with `select`) and/or the number of rows (with `filter`). To use `select`, name the columns to keep, separated by a comma. For example, let's select the species, year, sex, and body mass.

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

```{r}
# Hint: check your column names first
colnames(penguins)
```

```{r}
# select species, year, sex, and body mass
penguins_selected <- select(penguins, species, year, sex, body_mass_g)
# Take a look at the 'dimensions' with dim()
dim(penguins_selected)
```
The select columns can also be used to remove columns (unselect) rather than select by using the `-` operator. For example, we may want to remove only two columns, island and year:

```{r}
# Un-select the island and year columns by using -.
penguins_unselected <- select(penguins, -island, -year)
# Take a look at the 'dimensions' with dim()
dim(penguins_unselected)
```

New, let's filter the data based on a certain condition. Creating 'conditions' in R means writing logical statements with a response that will be either TRUE or FALSE. To write conditions we can use [comparative operators](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_operators.asp), which give a logical output: 

| Comparative Operator | Name                     | Example |
|----------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| ==                   | Equal                    | x == y  |
| !=                   | Not equal                | x != y  |
| >                    | Greater than             | x > y   |
| <                    | Less than                | x < y   |
| >=                   | Greater than or equal to | x >= y  |
| <=                   | Less than or equal to    | x <= y  |

```{r}
penguins$year == 2007
```

The filter function evaluates those conditions, and keeps only the rows for which the value os TRUE. For example, let's filter observations so that we only keep those from the year 2007.
```{r}
penguins_filtered <- filter(penguins, year == 2007)
dim(penguins_filtered)
```

There are other functions to evaluate columns and get a T/F output. An important one is `is.na()`. This function evaluates a column and reports back a TRUE value when there is an NA in that column's row. For example, we can use the `head()` function to look at the top 6 values of the `sex` column, and see that there is an NA in the fourth row.

```{r}
head(penguins$sex)
```

The `is.na` function evaluates the whole column and gives us TRUES whenever it sees an NA. Not surprisingly, we see a TRUE in the fourth observation.  

```{r}
is.na(penguins$sex)
```

Since `is.na()` gives us a T/F vector, it is already a good candidate for putting right into filter. Below we are asking the filter function to keep only the observations that have an NA in the sex column.
```{r}
penguins_filtered_nas <- filter(penguins, is.na(sex))
dim(penguins_filtered_nas)
```
To do the reverse, i.e. keep only the observations that do NOT have an NA in the sex column, we can use the `!` sign to denote 'not' and reverse the T/F.

```{r}
penguins_filtered_nonas <- filter(penguins, !is.na(sex))
dim(penguins_filtered_nonas)
```

You can combined multiple conditions using [logical operators](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_operators.asp):

| Logical Operator | Name    | Example           |
|------------------|---------|-------------------|
| &                | AND     | x == 2 & y == 10  |
| |                | OR      | x == 2 | y == 10  |


## Combining multiple steps 

There are several ways to combine steps in coding. You can perform one function at a time and save intermediate objects as you work, you can 'nest' functions, or you can use 'pipes' (`%>%`). So for example, if you wanted to select the species, sex, bill length, and bill depth, and filter data so to only keep data 'Adelie' penguins, with no NAs in the sex column, these first two options would look as follows:

```{r}
# Multiple steps with intermediate objects
penguins_step1 <- select(penguins, species, sex, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm)
penguins_step2 <- filter(penguins_step1, species == 'Adelie' & !is.na(sex))
summary(penguins_step2)
```

```{r}
# Multiple steps with nested functions
penguins_nested <- filter(select(penguins, species, sex, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm), 
                          species == 'Adelie' & !is.na(sex))
summary(penguins_nested)
```

The third option is pipes. Pipes let you take the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when you need to do many things to the same data set. Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the `magrittr` package, installed automatically with the `tidyverse`. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with Ctrl + Shift + M if you have a PC or Cmd + Shift + M if you have a Mac.

```{r}
# Multiple steps with pipes
penguins_piped <- penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm) %>% 
  filter(species == 'Adelie' & !is.na(sex))
summary(penguins_piped)
```
We will use the piping approach, as it helps make a smoother workflow for other wrangling functions we'll use.

### Check in challenge

Use pipes to select only the columns for species, sex, bill_length_mm, and body_mass_g, and filter out where sex is missing and body_mass_g is greater than 3500. Name this new data frame 'filter_challenge' and look at a summary of it to check your work.

```{r}
filter_challenge <- penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) %>% 
  filter(is.na(sex) & body_mass_g > 3500)
str(filter_challenge)
```

## Creating new variables

### New columns

We may often want to make a new column with some updated or transformed value. We can use the `mutate` function for this, in which you can assign the new column name and its value. The idea is generally mutate(data, new_column_name = value). For example, if we wanted to calculate a new value, the ratio of bill length to bill depth, we could do the following

```{r}
# Mutate to create a new column; use penguins_piped so our output is
# easier to view
mutate(penguins_piped, bill_ratio = bill_length_mm / bill_depth_mm) 
```

Note that in order to save the column in the data frame, we must assign it as a new data frame object. The output of mutate is not just a new column on its own, but the whole data frame with the new column appended. So far we have not overwritten in, and we can see that bill_depth_cm is not in our penguins data frame
```{r}
colnames(penguins_piped)
```

Only once we assign it do we have a data frame now with the new column appended

```{r}
penguins_newcolumn <- mutate(penguins_piped, bill_ratio = bill_length_mm / bill_depth_mm) 
colnames(penguins_newcolumn)
```

In addition to the mathematical transformations we just tried, we may want to create new, discrete categories with our data. For example, let's categorize bill length into discrete size groups, small, 

```{r}
summary(penguins_newcolumn$bill_ratio)
```

All values are greater than 1, so all bill lengths are greater than depths. Still, lower ratio values mean that the bill depth is large relative to its length (deep bills) and higher values mean that bill depth is small relative to its length (shallow bills). Let's say we wanted to use these bill lengths ratios to group penguins into one of three groups: 'deep' 'average' and 'shallow'.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align='center',  fig.cap = 'Artwork by @allison_horst'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/culmen_depth.png")
```


The `case_when` functions, combined with `mutate`, lets us set multiple conditions and resulting categories. This function uses a series of two-sided formulas where the left-hand side determines describes the condition, and the right supplies the result. The final condition should always be TRUE, meaning that when the previous conditions have not been met, assign the last value. 

Using these functions we can create a depth ratio category variable:

```{r}
penguins_newcolumn <- penguins_newcolumn %>% 
  mutate(bill_depth_cat = case_when(
    # Using the 1st Q as cutoff
    bill_ratio <= 2.013 ~ 'deep',
    # Between 1st and 2rd Q
    bill_ratio > 2.013 & bill_ratio <= 2.239 ~ 'average',
    T ~ 'shallow'
  ))

penguins_newcolumn$bill_depth_cat
```

A note: Always be cautious about what might be left out when naming the conditions. In the previous example, we assumes that everything left after the first two conditions would be shallow. To be on the safe side, I often set every condition and leave the last condition either an error notice, or NA, so that I can check my conditions.

```{r}
penguins_newcolumn <- penguins_newcolumn %>% 
  mutate(bill_depth_cat = case_when(
    # Using the 1st Q as cutoff
    bill_ratio <= 2.013 ~ 'deep',
    # Between 1st and 2rd Q
    bill_ratio > 2.013 & bill_ratio <= 2.239 ~ 'average',
    bill_ratio >= 2.239 ~ 'shallow',
    T ~ 'error'
  ))

head(penguins_newcolumn$bill_depth_cat)
```

### Summary tables

Often we want to aggregate data at certain levels to better understand differences across groups. For instance, does flipper length differ by species? Does body mass change between years? We can combined `group_by` and `summarize` to help answer that. `group_by` sets a column (or columns) by which you want to perform a summarizing function on, then `summarize` creates a new variable by performing a variety of summary/transformative functions on an existing column. 

First, we can use sumamrize on its own, without any grouping, to get a single summary about the data frame. For example, if we want to know the mean body mass:

```{r}
# calculate the mean body mass for the whole data frame
summarize(penguins, mean_body_mass_g = mean(flipper_length_mm))
```

If the result is NA, be sure to include the 'na.rm = T' argument to tell the function to 'remove NAs' before calculating:
```{r}
# set na.rm = T
summarize(penguins, mean_flipper_length_mm = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T))
```

But if we want to know the mean flipper length across certain grouping variables, such as sex, we want to combine summarize with group_by.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_flipper_length_mm = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T))
```

We group_by multiple columns at once, AND summarize can create several new summary variables within the same summarize function, just separating by a comma in both cases. For instance, we can group by species and sex, and generate two summary variables of mean and standard deviation flipper length:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species,sex) %>% 
  summarize(mean_flipper_length_mm = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T),
            sd_flipper_length_mm = sd(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T))
```

### Check in challenge

Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each year-sex combination. Before calculating those summaries, remove the observations where there is no data for penguin sex. Name this new summary table 'summary_challenge'. What is the mean and standard deviation of the body mass for male penguins in 2008?

            sd_body_mass_g = sd(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))
